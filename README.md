BowlingGame
===========
* There are 10 pins total, each counts as 1 point. 
* Each frame has up to 2 balls that can be thrown. 
* If a strike is bowled (all pins knocked down on first throw), the second ball is not thrown. 
* A strike counts as 10 points, plus the value of the next 2 balls thrown. A maximum of 30 points is possible per frame (10+10+10). 
* A spare (all pins knocked down in 2 throws) counts as 10 points plus the value of the next ball thrown. A maximum of 20 * points is possible for a spare (10+10). 
* The 10th frame is a special frame whereby up to 3 balls can be thrown if a strike or a spare are bowled. 
* If a strike is thrown on the first ball, 2 additional balls are thrown. 
* If a spare is thrown on the second ball, an extra ball is thrown. 
The maximum score possible for a game is 300 (10 frames x 30 points per frame) if only strikes are bowled.
